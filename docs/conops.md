# Concept of Operations - `svc-discovery`

## :telescope: Overview

This microservice is the API for other service providers (U-space service providers (USSPs) as an example) to interact with the Aetheric network. Likewise, it also allows our network to make requests to external service providers to allow users to access vertiports outside of our network.

## :raised_hands: Motivation

Core to the future of UAM networks is the concept of interoperability: that numerous networks can cooperate to provide global vertiport coverage for all.

Frameworks like U-space allow service providers (like Aetheric) to communicate schedules, meteorological reports, and other data to other service providers in a common fashion.
