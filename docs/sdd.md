## Overview

This document details the software implementation of svc-discovery.

This microservice is the API for other service providers (U-space service providers (USSPs) as an example) to interact with the Arrow network. Likewise, it also allows our network to make requests to external service providers to allow users to access vertiports outside of our network.
